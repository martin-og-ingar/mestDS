'''
Values not specified in the yml file will use default values specified in the Simulation file
You can define your own country, use the default counrty or select a counrty from our repository

You can create one simulation by just defining base. If you wish to generate multiple simulations,
you can use grid_evaluation where you can define which values to be included in the grid evaluation and the values to be tested.
If values is not defined, it will use a low, medium and high value. 

If you can also use sim, then you will have more control over the specified simulations. In sim you can define values for specific attributes.
